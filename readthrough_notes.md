Execution order

Setup 

Ask firms to:
 - if partnership startegy collaborate
	- This is the partnership basically. Exactly as described in the paper, so use that explanation.
 - do-research
	- keep in mind that they have added a success threshold that is basically a pofit margin (check this assumption)
 - manufacture
	- includes pricing; note that pricing activity sets price at random. Can this be improved upon?
	- note that they chose to "give up" during the make-input function. What consequences does that have?
 - pay-taxes
 
Ask model:
find-suppliers
buy

Ask firms to:
 - take-profit
 - adjust price
	- basically if you have more than 4 customers, increase price by 10%, if 0, decrease 10%. else go steady. This seems like insanity to me since you would know that if there are others selling the same product you would not be chosen.... 
 
Ask model:
 - create-start-ups
	- copies the most successful in the last round, gets starting capital, and some of its kenes (shorter the less capital) the keens are chosen from the IH
 - create-nets
	- only one network possible at a time; only created if above success threshold; the network is its own organization
 - show plots

Ask networks:
 - distribute-network-profits
	- distributes any profits above the initial-capital equally among the members; the initial capital is extracted equally from the members at start-up; if capital below initial capital do nothing; if capital = 0 kill the network

Ask firms:
 - do-admin
   - disolves partnerships; updates previous partners; there doesn't seem to be any mechanism of network deterioration?
